    <h1>OSINT and Online Privacy</h1>
    <h2>What is OSINT?<h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/open-source-intelligence-definition">Recorded Future</a> has an excellent in-depth article on what OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
        is but in summary it's information about you that can be gathered from publicly available sources.</p>
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>Now that you know a little about OSINT, perhaps you are wondering how you can maintain your privacy on the internet? The simplest way is to never use
        the internet, but since that's not very practical these days here are a few simple ways to avoid having your internet activity linked to you from purely OSINT.
        Even if you work on hardening your internet presence against OSINT, it is still possible to open yourself to privacy risks through malware, phishing, and
        social engineering, but it's always best to do everything you can to make it harder for the bad guys.</p>
