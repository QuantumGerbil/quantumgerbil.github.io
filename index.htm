    <h1>OSINT and Online Privacy</h1>
    <h2>What is OSINT?</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/open-source-intelligence-definition">Recorded Future</a> has an excellent in-depth article on what OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
        is but in summary it's kind of like being a detective, but instead of sneaking around, you find clues in places where anyone can look. Think of all the stuff people share on social media—photos, tweets, live videos, the works. OSINT is when you sift through all that openly shared info to figure out useful things. For instance, say you're scrolling through Instagram and notice lots of photos from a big concert. That's OSINT in action if you're trying to gauge how popular the event was. Or if you hop on Twitter and see lots of folks tweeting from a certain location, you've got a good guess of where something big is happening. And it's not just for fun – journalists can use it to check facts, businesses can use it to understand their customers better, and the police might use it to keep a neighborhood safe. So next time you're on your favorite social media app, remember, you're not just seeing posts, you're looking at a goldmine of open-source intel!</p>
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>Now that you know a little of what OSINT is, here are some tips on other ways you can stay safe on the internet:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>First up, passwords. You wouldn’t use the same key for your house, car, and office, right? Same goes for passwords. Reusing them is like giving a skeleton key to hackers! So mix it up, and if remembering a zillion passwords isn’t your thing, a password manager can be your new BFF. It’s like a secret diary that keeps all your passwords locked up tight and super handy.</p></li>
        <li><p>You know when you're signing up for that cool new newsletter or the latest buzzworthy app and they ask for your email? It's like giving a piece of your digital identity away, right? But hey, there's a nifty trick to keep your real email under wraps—using an email address anonymizing service. It's like having a decoy email! You sign up through the service and it forwards stuff to your real inbox without anyone else getting wise to your actual address. Think of it as your email's stunt double; it takes the hits so your inbox doesn't have to. This way, your main email stays uncluttered (and unstalked), and you still get all the good stuff you signed up for. Plus, if one of those sign-ups turns into a spam fest, you can just pull the plug on that alias without any drama. Neat, huh?</p></li>
        <li><p>And cookies—nope, not the chocolate chip kind, but the ones online that track everything you do. A little privacy, please! Get yourself a cookie blocker to keep those digital crumbs from spreading all over the internet.</p></li></ul>
