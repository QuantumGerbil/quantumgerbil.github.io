    <h1>OSINT and Online Privacy</h1>
    <h2>What is OSINT?<h2>
      <p>OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) is, as defined by Wikipedia, "the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (covert sources and publicly available information (PAI)) to produce actionable intelligence." Sounds pretty serious right? In laymen's terms, OSINT is effectively any information about yourself which you intentionally or unintentionally leave in a publicly accessible location which can be used to identify you, track you, or infer further information about you. This includes pictures you leave on Instagram which let people know your preferences or habits and can be used with a little additional knowledge can reveal far more than you intended. It can also include posts on social media about an event you're attending which unintentionally lets people know more about your interests, where you are, how long you might be out of the house, and what route you might take home. In the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, OSINT has been used with great effect to identify troop movements, identify where to fire missiles, as well as to infer what a general or political leader might be planning in the near future. This tactic is also used by cybercriminals before attempting a hack or a scam. For the average internet user one simply has to type in their e-mail address to find their name as well as a list of usernames they might use which then makes it possible to find out what online services they might use. Knowing what services someone uses might allow for a more targeted scam which increases the chance of it succeeding. It can also allow hackers more insight into how to break into a system that person owns or might have access to.</p>
