    <p>See all these characters and things that make words and sentences? This is my ever so silly attempt at teaching the principals of Cyber Security in a way that anyone can understand it.</p>

    <h1>OSINT and Online Privacy</h1>
    <h2>What is OSINT?</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/open-source-intelligence-definition">Recorded Future</a> has an excellent in-depth article on what OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence)
        is but in summary it's kind of like being a detective, but instead of sneaking around, you find clues in places where anyone can look. Think of all the stuff people share on social media—photos, tweets, live videos, the works. OSINT is when you sift through all that openly shared info to figure out useful things. For instance, say you're scrolling through Instagram and notice lots of photos from a big concert. That's OSINT in action if you're trying to gauge how popular the event was. Or if you hop on Twitter and see lots of folks tweeting from a certain location, you've got a good guess of where something big is happening. And it's not just for fun – journalists can use it to check facts, businesses can use it to understand their customers better, and the police might use it to keep a neighborhood safe. So next time you're on your favorite social media app, remember, you're not just seeing posts, you're looking at a goldmine of open-source intel!</p>
      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>Now that you know a little of what OSINT is, here are some tips on other ways you can stay safe on the internet:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>First up, passwords. You wouldn’t use the same key for your house, car, and office, right? Same goes for passwords. Reusing them is like giving a skeleton key to hackers! So mix it up, and if remembering a zillion passwords isn’t your thing, a password manager can be your new BFF. It’s like a secret diary that keeps all your passwords locked up tight and super handy.</p></li>
        <li><p>You know when you're signing up for that cool new newsletter or the latest buzzworthy app and they ask for your email? It's like giving a piece of your digital identity away, right? But hey, there's a nifty trick to keep your real email under wraps—using an email address anonymizing service. It's like having a decoy email! You sign up through the service and it forwards stuff to your real inbox without anyone else getting wise to your actual address. Think of it as your email's stunt double; it takes the hits so your inbox doesn't have to. This way, your main email stays uncluttered (and unstalked), and you still get all the good stuff you signed up for. Plus, if one of those sign-ups turns into a spam fest, you can just pull the plug on that alias without any drama. Neat, huh?</p></li>
        <li><p>And cookies—nope, not the chocolate chip kind, but the ones online that track everything you do. A little privacy, please! Get yourself a cookie blocker to keep those digital crumbs from spreading all over the internet.</p></li>

      <h2>Privacy++</h2>
      <p>Starting to feel a bit nervous about using the internet? Good! The instant you forget that there are potentially thousands of people watching what you do on the internet and not just that Tik Tok you uploaded, you are at risk of slipping up and putting too much online and making yourself the target for some scammers or someone else. Try these additional tips that should keep you extra safe!</p>
      <h3>Encrypted E-mail</h3>
      <p>To best explain this tip to you I think you need to know a bit of cybersecurity lingo. First off, you have "in-the-clear." This means that whatever file or bit of data it's describing is stored on the computer or being sent over the internet in a way that anyone who looks at it can read it. Another good term to know is "encrypted." Encrypted means that the bit of data or file is stored or being transmitted in such a way that if someone were to look at it it would just look like random numbers and stuff. Only someone with the key can read it, and the only one with the key should be the one it's intended for. Did you know e-mails are stored and sent in-the-clear? No? Well you do now. If someone were to get access to the server that contains your gmail or yahoo account they could read everything you've got in there as well as everything you've sent. That Outlook program you use at work to get your e-mails can use encrypted e-mails, but more often then not those too are in-the-clear. Unless you like knowing that literally anyone can read your e-mails, you should get an ecrypted e-mail service, preferably one based out of Sweden or Switzerland where they have really strict privacy laws.</p>
      <h3>VPN</h3>
      <p>You probably see ads for VPNs everywhere nowadays. Do they really work? Kinda. A good VPN service makes it so that if someone were to try to monitor your internet traffic, they'd be able to see you are using a VPN, but would not be able to read anything being sent between your computer and other locations on the internet because it would be encrypted. Using a VPN doesn't necessarily mean that your internet usage is encrypted so you need to be sure of that unless all you're using it for is to change the location you appear to be accessing your Netflix from so you can watch another region's content.</p>
      <h3>Internet-of-Things (IoT)</h3>
      <p>Just say no! As cool as that front door camera doorbell thingy or baby monitor that lets you check in from work seems, they all work by sending your data (usually very private data) outside of your house to a server owned by a business that doesn't care at all about your privacy and just wants your money. Just a quick search on YouTube of how hackers use that stuff should convince you it's probably not worth it. If you're tech savvy enough to run your own IoT server and buy only devices that communicate with that server then go for it. Doing it that way is safe and not too difficult to set up. Anything that doesn't support a personally owned server should be destroyed with extreme prejudice!</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Is that everything? I think so. You should hopefully understand a bit of what OSINT is and will think about what you put online more. I'm intentionally trying not to advertise anything here since they don't pay me, but you should have an idea now on what sort of services you might need to look for if you use E-mails and VPN. Good luck traversing the dystopian hellscape that is the modern internet!</p>
